# PixelWebhooks
Small and simple Sponge plugin to send a customizable Discord embedded message to a webhook whenever a Pokemon within the customizable list spawns. Intended for announcing when a legendary Pokemon spawns but can be used for announcing whichever Pokemon

Fixed a few library issues in this version and added some commands:
/pixelwebhooks reload
/pixelwebhooks test - Sends a test webhook message
